STL - The Standard Template Library is a software 
library for the C++ programming language that 
influenced many parts of the C++ Standard Library. 
It provides four components called algorithms, 
containers, functions, and iterators.

    |-------Iterators-------|

Algorithms - In mathematics and computer science, 
an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, 
computer-implementable instructions, typically to 
solve a class of specific problems or to perform a 
computation.

Containers -
        Sequence containers (array, vector, list)
        Associative containers (set, map, multimap)
        Unordered Associative containers (unordered_set, unordered_map)
        Container Adapters (stack, queue)

Iterator -
        In computer programming, an iterator is 
        an object that enables a programmer to 
        traverse a container, particularly lists. 
        Various types of iterators are often 
        provided via a container's interface.

! Containers store the data.
! Data stored in containers is accessed by Iterators
! Algorithm work on iterators
